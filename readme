1. Login as root to a blank Ubuntu server. If you purchased a server, you should have received instructions in the setup email. If you are running this from home, install Ubuntu Server in a VirtualBox VM. **Make sure to use bridged networking**. WiFi isn’t supported by this script if you do not use a VM to run Ubuntu Server.

2. Change the current working directory to / by typing this command and pressing enter:

  cd /

3. Download the .zip from github and save it in / by typing this command and pressing enter:

  wget {URL of the .zip on GitHub}

(if wget isn’t installed, run “apt-get update;apt-get install wget”. Just paste everything between the quotes into the terminal window.)

4. Unzip the zip file you downloaded by typing this command and pressing enter. 

  unzip {name of the .zip file you downloaded. This should be shown near the end of wget’s output} 

(if unzip isn’t installed, run “apt-get update;apt-get install unzip”. Just paste everything between the quotes into the terminal window.)

5. Run the installer script by typing this command and pressing enter:

  bash /install

6. If you are running this behind a NAT appliance (such as a standard home router), forward ports 80/tcp and 53/udp to the eth0 IP shown when the installer finished. If you are running this on a VPS that isn’t behind NAT (such as most purchased VPSs) and the eth0 IP is blank, do not worry. 

7. Set your console to use the DNS IP shown at the end of the installer’s output.
